This repository is for Dockerfiles used by DockerHub's automated build system.
The `Dockerfile` files themselves are generated by running the `update-all`
script from the repo `docker-osg-wn-scripts`, which use `Dockerfile.in` files
as templates. Therefore, the `Dockerfile` files themselves should not be
directly modified.
